# ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot Frontend - Part 1: Simple Chat UI
#
# NOTE FOR ENTIRE EXERCISE:
# This frontend file (app.py) will NOT change throughout the 7-part tutorial.
# You will only work on different backend.py logic files for each part.
# When your initial backend.py is ready, uncomment lines 15-16 below to connect to your AI backend.

# --- Show Latest Commit Message ---
# This snippet displays the last commit message at the bottom-right of the Streamlit app.
# It first checks if a 'commit.txt' file exists (useful for deployments),
# otherwise it falls back to reading the latest commit from git.
# If neither is available, it shows a default message.
# No need to deep dive â€“ just a simple way to know what version of code is running.
